1.you have matrix NXM write function that print matrix in shablule style. TC-O(MXN) Space- O(MXN) / O(1).
2.you have array of arrays with variable length write method that print all combinations of numbers.
3.you hava array of numbers 1/0 write sorting function that sort array in TC-O(n) , what happen if you have 2/1/0.
